this is an project for my embedded systems course

This entire process gave me an insight on how creating and training a model works and what it truly takes to make it function. As I had no clue where to begin, I used ChatGPT to guide me through this process step by step. After every step, I made sure to understand every single line of code and its purpose so I would not just follow blindly. Doing this assignment gave me an insight on how much energy is used by models similar to the concept of this one and how efficiency plays a major role. For example, increasing the number of epochs would increase the accuracy of the model, but this also meant it would take much longer to train and, in turn, consume far more energy overall.
